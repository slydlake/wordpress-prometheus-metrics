== Installation ==

1. In Wordpress: Install the plugin in the plugin section. Manual: Download and upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/slymetrics/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Navigate to 'Settings' ‚Üí 'SlyMetrics' to configure authentication tokens
4. Copy your Bearer Token or API Key for use in your Prometheus configuration
5. Configure your Prometheus server to scrape the metrics endpoint

For detailed information take a look on the Github Page https://github.com/slydlake/slymetrics

**Prometheus Configuration Example:**

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'wordpress'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['yoursite.com']
    metrics_path: '/slymetrics/metrics'
    authorization:
      type: Bearer
      credentials: 'your_bearer_token_here'
    scrape_interval: 60s
```

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What endpoints are available for metrics? =

The plugin provides multiple endpoint options:

* Primary: `/slymetrics/metrics` (requires permalink support)
* Alternative: `/metrics` (requires permalink support)
* REST API: `/wp-json/slymetrics/v1/metrics`
* Fallback: `/index.php?rest_route=/slymetrics/v1/metrics`
* Query parameter: `/?slymetrics=1`

= Do I need to configure Apache or Nginx? =

No! The plugin works out-of-the-box without requiring server configuration changes. Fallback URLs are automatically provided if rewrites don't work.

= How secure is the authentication? =

Extremely secure with enterprise-grade features. All tokens are encrypted using AES-256-CBC with unique initialization vectors. Version 1.2.0 adds comprehensive security enhancements including input validation, SQL injection prevention, XSS protection, rate limiting (60 requests/minute), and security headers. You can also use environment variables for the encryption key in production.

= What metrics are exported? =

The plugin exports comprehensive metrics including user counts, post/page statistics, plugin/theme information, database sizes, PHP configuration, site health data, and much more. All metrics include site labels for multi-site environments.

= Can I use this with multi-site WordPress? =

Yes! All metrics include site labels, making it perfect for monitoring multi-site WordPress installations.

= What are the system requirements? =

* WordPress 5.0 or higher
* PHP 7.4 or higher
* OpenSSL PHP extension (recommended for encryption)
* WordPress administrator access for configuration
* Minimum 64MB PHP memory limit (recommended 128MB for optimal performance)
* Database with InnoDB support for performance metrics
